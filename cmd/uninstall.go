	Short: "Uninstall a binary",

Uninstall a binary tool at specified version (required)
for the host architecture and operating system:

hvm uninstall vault --version 0.7.2

hvm uninstall nomad --version 0.6.5
`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		fmt.Println("uninstall called")
	},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(uninstallCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// uninstallCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// uninstallCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}

# hvm

## What?

This is `hvm` the Hashi Version Manager. It is not an official HashiCorp project, but a personal one that was originally created to satisfy my need to work with multiple versions of the popular HashiCorp command line tools.

You can use `hvm` to install any known version of the following tools:

- consul
- nomad
- packer
- terraform
- vagrant
- vault
